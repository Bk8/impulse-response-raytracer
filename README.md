==========================

raytracing impulse response designer

There are three main things you need to worry about. The raytracing core lib is in /librayverb, the obj loader and tracer is in /tracer, and the trace renderer is in /flattener.

I'm not sure if this builds not-on-my-machine yet. To build, you'll need a copy of the JUCE library. You might have to muck around with the include paths too.

Who am I kidding no one else is going to compile this.
